## 🎯 DO THIS RIGHT NOW (2 minutes)

### **Submit Your Sitemap to Google Search Console**

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Select your property: `www.ignitexsolution.com`
3. Click "Sitemaps" in the left sidebar
4. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
5. Click "Submit"

✅ **Done!** Google will start indexing your pages within 24-48 hours.

## 🔴 CRITICAL - DO TODAY (2.5 hours)

### **1. Create OpenGraph Images (2 hours)**

**Why:** Social sharing is completely broken without these. When someone shares your site on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter, it shows nothing.

**What to Create:**
```
📁 /public/images/og-image.jpg (1200x630px)
📁 /public/images/twitter-image.jpg (1200x630px)
```

**Design Checklist:**
- [ ] IgniteX logo prominently displayed
- [ ] Tagline: "Beyond deadline before time"
- [ ] Stats: "50+ websites launched | 80% average ROI"
- [ ] Brand colors: Red (#DC2626), Black, White
- [ ] Professional, clean design
- [ ] Text readable at small sizes

**Quick Tools:**
- **Canva** (Easiest): https://www.canva.com/create/og-images/
  - Search "OG image template"
  - Customize with your branding
  - Download as JPG
  
- **Figma** (Professional): Use 1200x630px canvas
  
- **Photoshop**: Create 1200x630px canvas

**Pro Tip:** Create one design, save as both og-image.jpg and twitter-image.jpg

---

### **2. Add Real Contact Information (30 minutes)**

**Why:** Your LocalBusiness schema is invalid without real contact info. You won't appear in Google Maps or local search results.

**File to Edit:** `src/components/JsonLd.tsx`

**Changes Needed:**

```typescript
// Line 37 - Replace:
telephone: '+91-XXXXXXXXXX',
// With your actual phone:
telephone: '+91-YOUR-PHONE-NUMBER',

// Line 81 - Replace (duplicate):
telephone: '+91-XXXXXXXXXX',
// With your actual phone:
telephone: '+91-YOUR-PHONE-NUMBER',

// Line 85 - Add your address:
streetAddress: 'Your Street Address, Building Name',

// Line 88 - Add your postal code:
postalCode: 'Your Postal Code (e.g., 831001)',

// Lines 93-94 - Verify coordinates (optional):
latitude: 22.8046,  // Update if you have exact coordinates
longitude: 86.2029, // Update if you have exact coordinates
```

**How to Get Exact Coordinates:**
1. Go to Google Maps
2. Right-click your business location
3. Click the coordinates that appear
4. Copy and paste into JsonLd.tsx
